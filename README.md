VRIM nodes are part of the VRIM Project, a Virtual Reconstruction Information Management proposal. VRIM Dynamo Package and its nodes are a collection of practical nodes to manage flexible profiles and path for moulding of classical architecture. The VRIM package were designed to assist the modelling of elements of classical architecture into BIM environment. The topic was not been treated by the Dynamo team. In particular, two solutions are implemented as recursive functions, which means that solutions can read Input from an Excel File and then create geometries.
