# 1.5. Geometry

Set of nodes related to geometrical atoms that can be used to define a profile or a path of a moulding.

Each geometrical atom is subdivided in a category encoded by a number. The encoding number is followed by a letter that indicate a different configuration of each geometrical atom.

Each geometrical atom is based on a deformable 9 points grid, and it has a stat point and an end point. The start point is the anchor point that allow to connect atoms to each others.
