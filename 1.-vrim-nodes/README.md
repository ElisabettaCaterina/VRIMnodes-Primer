# 1. VRIM nodes

In this section a description of nodes available inside VRIM Dynamo Package.

_" In Dynamo, **Nodes** are the objects you connect to form a Visual Program. Each **Node** performs an operation - sometimes that may be as simple as storing a number or it may be a more complex action such as creating or querying geometry."_

According with [The Dynamo Primer](http://dynamoprimer.com/en/index.html) a Node is composed by **Five Parts** and **Ports**

1. **Name** - The Name of the Node with a Category.Name naming convention
2. **Main** - The main body of the Node - Right-clicking here presents options at the level of the whole Node
3. **Ports** \(In and Out\) - The receptors for Wires that supply the input data to the Node as well as the results of the Node's action.  The Inputs and Outputs for Nodes are called Ports and act as the receptors for Wires. Data comes into the Node through Ports on the left and flows out of the Node after it has executed its operation on the right. Ports expect to receive data of a certain type.
4. **Lacing Icon** - Indicates the Lacing option specified for matching list inputs \(more on that later\)
5. **Default Value** - Right-click on an input Port - some Nodes have default values that can be used or not used.
